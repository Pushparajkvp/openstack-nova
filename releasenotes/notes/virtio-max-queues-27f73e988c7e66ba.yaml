    The nova libvirt virt driver supports creating instances with multi-queue
    virtio network interfaces. In previous releases nova has based the maximum
    number of virtio queue pairs that can be allocated on the reported kernel
    major version. It has been reported in `bug #1847367`_ that some distros have
    backported changes from later major versions that make major version
    number no longer suitable to determine the maximum virtio queue pair count.
    A new config option has been added to the libvirt section of the nova.conf.
    When defined nova will now use the ``[libvirt]/max_queues`` option to
    define the max queues that can be configured, if undefined it will
    fallback to the previous kernel version approach.
